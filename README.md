## Hacky php solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), working on past problems.
Most of these solutions work (eventually), but are very slow at times. They are not optimised. They are mostly uncommented. They frequently use nondescript variable names

Note that the answers commented in some files are for my assigned input so the input file will need to be changed. The purpose of these programs is for me to learn and solve these problems. You are free to run the code unchanged (not recommended) or use the underlying logic to implement your own version.
